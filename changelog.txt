Stats
- Ratio of links to messages
- Add channel specific stats (top 5 users, most used emoji, average char length, number of messages, percent of server)
- Graph of total messages sent in a channel over time

Commands
- Per person, customizable options for !timeout (what they want to be shown at the final pm). Options such as:
	* Progress bar for how close your timeout is to being done (would require a pm to be sent immediately)
	* Only locking you out of certain channels
	* Ignoring certain channels in the "activity while you were gone" message
	* Tells you how many messages were sent while you were gone
- !status command to double check all channels and roles and see if anything has changed (particularly in relation to the DB, delete or add as necessary)
	
Features
- Carry over !timeout through resets

Bugs/Polish
- Fix DBFunctions with generic db method (almost there, just a couple things to iron out)
- Polish the changelog upload; delimit and add "roadmap" at the top
- Fix !help embed send to work instead of !help embed_send
